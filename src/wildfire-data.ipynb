    "# Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to collect and analyze wildfire data from a publicly available dataset. The dataset, retrieved from a US government repository, contains comprehensive information about wildfires. Our goal is to process this dataset and calculate the distance between each wildfire location and the city of 'Muskogee, Oklahoma'. Once this analysis is complete, we will save the resulting dataset as a separate CSV file for further exploration and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary data source for this notebook is the 'Wildfire dataset,' which can be accessed from the following link: Wildfire dataset. This dataset is maintained by a US government agency and provides valuable insights into historical wildfire events. It contains a wealth of information, including the location, size, year, and other attributes of each wildfire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Processing Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Retrieval**: We will start by retrieving the wildfire data from the provided dataset. This step involves downloading and loading the dataset into our analysis environment.\n",
    "- **Distance Calculation**: After obtaining the wildfire data, we will calculate the geographical distance between each wildfire location and the city of 'Muskogee, Oklahoma.' This analysis will provide us with valuable information about the proximity of wildfires to this specific city.\n",
    "- **Data Storage**: To facilitate further analysis and research, we will store the resulting dataset, which includes calculated distances, in a separate CSV file. This file will serve as the basis for future investigations and can be easily shared with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between wildfires and the city of 'Muskogee, Oklahoma.' The resulting dataset will be a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in wildfire analysis and its impact on specific regions."
